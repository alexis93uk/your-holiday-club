    <h2>Our Future Plans</h2>
    <p>
      We are continuously working on expanding our network to make it more engaging and interactive. 
      Soon, users will be able to create their own accounts, log in, personalize their profiles, and 
      post their own travel experiences directly to the platform. This will foster deeper connections, 
      exchange of valuable insights, and inspiration for all travelers.
