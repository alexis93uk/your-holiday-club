## Database Structure 

relational schema that satisfies criteria 1.4:

- **`users`**  
  - `id` INTEGER PK,  
  - `username` TEXT UNIQUE,  
  - `email` TEXT,  
  - `password_hash` TEXT  

- **`stories`**  
  - `id` INTEGER PK,  
  - `user_id` INTEGER FK ‚Üí `users.id`,  
  - `location` TEXT,  
  - `story_text` TEXT  

Each story record belongs to exactly one user. I seed a `default_user` on first run and link sample stories, demonstrating the one-to-many relationship in practice.
